Resolve on Windows and MacOS support most of the codecs available, but not all

It is recommended to mainly use these codecs:
- DNx* Videos
- h264/5 Videos
- PNG / JPEG Images
- WAV Audio @ 48 kHz

Use https://handbrake.fr/ (GUI TOOL) or https://www.ffmpeg.org/ (COMMAND LINE) to convert your media.

More on the acceptable formats here.
