When viewing Z values in the viewport, by default Fusion will scale the depth values so that z = 0 is black and z = -1000 is white. Depending on the scale of your scene, this may make all the z values in your viewport appear solid white or solid black. You can change these default values in Preferences -> View -> Displayed Depth Range. To have Fusion automatically map depth values so that black is the depth of the nearest pixel and white is the furthest, you can turn on view normalization.
