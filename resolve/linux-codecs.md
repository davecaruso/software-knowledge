Resolve on Linux doesn't like a lot of file formats.

Quick summary of what is allowed
- DNx* Videos
- PNG Images
- WAV Audio

and what is not
- H264 and most compressed mov and mp4 formats
- MP3 Files

Use https://handbrake.fr/ (GUI TOOL) or https://www.ffmpeg.org/ (COMMAND LINE) to convert your media.
