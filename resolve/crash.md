There is a small issue with DaVinci Resolve where it crashes a lot. Trying to preview a clip you
just made? *CRASH*. Trying to run a Planar Tracker? *CRASH*. Trying to start up the program? *CRASH*

There are some workarounds and things to try out first before panicking:
- Is it consistent to an action? See if theres something wrong with the node or clip you are working
  on.
- In the case of a startup crash, have you restarted your computer?
- If you're messing around with Fuses or Scripts, make sure you aren't running into any null errors.
