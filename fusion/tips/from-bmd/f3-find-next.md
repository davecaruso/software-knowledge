Ctrl+F brings up the Find dialog, but that disappears as soon as you hit 'Find Next' or 'Find Previous'. If you want to keep finding, just hit F3 to cycle though all the tools that match the search criteria. You can do this at any time, so by tagging your tools with a special substring, you can cycle through a set of tools very easily, even if they are in different parts of your comp.
