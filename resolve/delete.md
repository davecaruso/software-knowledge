Resolve differeniats between DELETE and BACKSPACE.
Delete makes a ripple delete, which means that the gap of the deleted clip will be filled by the footage behind it.
Backspace just deletes the clip and does not move anything around it.

You can change keyboard assignments in Resolve -> Keyboard Customization.
