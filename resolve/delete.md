Resolve has two delete actions: `Delete Selected` and `Ripple Delete`. While they both delete the selected clip, they do so in different ways.

**Delete Selected** (Default Key=`Backspace`)
Removes the selected clip, and only the selected clip. Nothing else in the timeline is modified.

**Ripple Delete** (Default Key=`Delete`)
Removes the selected clip, and all other clips above and below, and then clears the gap by moving footage after it into the gap.

You can change keyboard assignments in Resolve -> Keyboard Customization.
