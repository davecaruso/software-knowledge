The viewers have a normalize button as well as a color channel button. If you are viewing RGB images and press the normalize button, you will normalize the RGB according to the luminance. Changing the channel view will show you the channel of that result. However, if you view the individual channels, then turn on normalize, you will re-normalize to the values of that channel only.
